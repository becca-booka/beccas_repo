## **Level_2, Task_17 - HyperionDev Software Engineering Boot Camp**
### **Compulsory_Task_1**

#### _**Project Description**_
For this task we were asked to create a little online store webpage using html, CSS and Bootstrap. The goal of this task was to introduce us to Boostrap and to test our knowledge of html and CSS. Our web page had to have at least 10 images, buttons under each image that read "add to cart", buttons at the top of the webpage that read "login" and "shopping cart" (these buttons did not have to work, they just needed to be there to show that we understood how to add buttons to a webpage using html), and a form section that customers could use to leave their contact details and any messages they wished to share with the seller. For this task I met all the requirements and got 100%.  

#### _**Installation**_
In order to intsall my project locally you will need the following:
* Internet connection
* A code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Within the code you must include a Bootstrap stylesheet link for CSS, which you can find [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)

#### _**Usage**_
This project is not meant to act as a real online store and was created as in order to test my ability to use Bootstrap, CSS and html. The following images below show what the webpage looks like when deployed.
